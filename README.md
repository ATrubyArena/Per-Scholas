# üè¶ Per Scholas Capstone Project

This project was developed as part of the **Per Scholas Data Engineering** program. The goal was to build a robust ETL data pipeline for a financial institution using **PySpark**, **MySQL**, and a **Python-based CLI**. The pipeline extracts data from multiple sources, transforms it for quality and consistency, loads it into a relational database, and includes business intelligence visualizations.
