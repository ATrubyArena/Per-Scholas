# Per Scholas Capstone Project

This project was developed as part of the Per Scholas Data Engineering program. The goal was to build a complete ETL data pipeline for a financial institution using **PySpark**, **MySQL**, and **Python CLI tools**. The pipeline includes data extraction, transformation, loading into a relational database, and visualization of key business metrics.
