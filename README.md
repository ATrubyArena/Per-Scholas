# üè¶ Per Scholas Capstone Project

This project was developed as part of the **Per Scholas Data Engineering** program. The objective was to build a robust ETL data pipeline for a financial institution using **PySpark**, **MySQL**, and **Python CLI** tools. The pipeline performs **data extraction**, **transformation**, and **loading (ETL)**, with built-in business intelligence visualizations.
